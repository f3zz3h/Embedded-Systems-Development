Twisted Python RTSP Library
by David Bern
---------------------------

This library extends the Twisted Python library to include RTSP and RDT
protocls. It also includes support for handling ASMRP, SDPP, and RMFF
transported over those protocols.

To use the library to download a Real RTSP stream:
python rdt.py -u <URL> -f <FILENAME>
